Exploring Hindi Language with Bigram Models, Neural Networks, and GPT 🚀📜

Over the past few days, I’ve been working on a project focused on Hindi language modeling — and it’s been both technically challenging and unexpectedly fascinating!

I started with Wikipedia Hindi articles from Kaggle, cleaning the dataset so that it only contained pure Devanagari characters. From there, the journey unfolded in three main steps:

1️⃣ Bigram Analysis
A bigram model predicts the next character based on the current one (in simple terms — it learns which two characters often appear together).
I created a heatmap of bigram frequencies — essentially a visual map showing which character pairs are most common. The patterns were surprisingly rich, even in such a simple model.

2️⃣ Neural Network with Embeddings
Next, I used a small neural network with an embedding table to represent characters as vectors. The results were visualized in 2D and 3D, revealing how the model “thinks” characters are related in vector space. (Full interactive 3D plot available on my GitHub.)

3️⃣ From Bigram to GPT
Finally, I upgraded the architecture to a GPT-style language model to generate full Hindi sentences. While not perfect (trained only on Wikipedia text, not on the works of great Hindi poets like Dinkar), the results were much more coherent and natural than I expected.

💡 What I Learned

Language is full of hidden patterns — once you see them, it changes how you think about everyday communication.

A model can pick up the basics of a language in hours with good compute power — something that takes us humans months or even years! (I’ve been learning German for over a year, but my model “learned” Hindi sentence structure in days!)

Even simple models like bigrams can uncover fascinating structure in a language, while more advanced architectures can create surprisingly human-like text.

I’ve shared heatmaps, embeddings, and generated samples on my GitHub — if you love NLP, languages, or just curious about AI in Hindi, you might find it interesting.
